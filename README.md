## Coursera - Google Career Capstone: Applying Project Management in the Real World

## Activity Overview
In this activity, you will review supporting materials and add the project scope, costs, and benefits to your project charter. You will also identify an aspect of the project as being out-of-scope and add it to the charter.

Keep in mind that project charters can differ significantly from project to project and company to company. However, most charters include some variation of the components described in this activity. No matter what form they take, charters lay out project goals, highlight benefits, and help keep stakeholders aligned.

At the end of this activity, you should have a completed project charter.


> Scenario
> 
>Now that Peta has clarified and updated the project goals, she checks in with Deanna, Carter, Gilly, and Alex to discuss their concerns about the project’s scope. 

### Step 1: Access your draft
Begin by opening the project charter draft you updated in your last activity, *Update your project charter goals*. 

As you complete these instructions, you will **update** the following sections of your project charter:
- Scope and Exclusion
- Benefits & Costs
- Appendix

### Step 2: Access the supporting materials
The following materials will help you complete this activity. Keep them open as you proceed with the next steps. Each link will open a new Coursera tab.
- [Meeting: Scope Details](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applying-project-management/resources/oGvLo)
- [Tablet Implementation Cost](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applying-project-management/resources/DiTdO)

**Note**: To review supporting materials introduced in earlier activities, you can find them in the [Resources section](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applying-project-management/resources)

### Step 3: Determine the scope of the project

Review the meeting transcript to determine aspects of the project that are in scope or out-of-scope. Make note of any confusion or disagreement among the team regarding what should be included—or not included—in this project. (You are encouraged to make note of any other relevant project information as well. You may add this information to your notes or the project charter.)

Add any items that are part of this project to the **In-Scope section**. Any items that should be excluded from the project to the **Out-of-Scope** section of your charter draft.

### Step 4: Identify the benefits and costs of the project 

Review the Cost Sheet and add project costs to the **Benefits & Costs** section of your project charter draft. Then, review existing project documentation for more details that you can add to the **Benefits & Costs section**. 

Consider the following **Guiding Questions** when determining the benefits and costs of this project: 

- What is the biggest problem you are trying to solve?
- What defines “success” or “completion” to you?
- What are the biggest risks for this project?
- What are the resources and timeline needed?
- What are the outcomes? 
- What is the indirect or long term impact?  
- Who is the audience or beneficiary?

### Step 5: Identify misalignments 

Review the meeting transcript to identify misalignments among stakeholders. You should have a total of 4-6 misalignments documented in your charter.

Add these to the **Appendix** of your project charter. Be sure to record whether they were resolved, and what the resolutions were. If they were not resolved, note any next steps for resolving them.

### Step 6: Save your work 

Be sure to save the project charter you drafted for this activity. You will revise and refine project artifacts, including the project charter, as you progress through the course.
