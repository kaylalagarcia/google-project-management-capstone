# Project Charter: [Menu Tablets Pilot]

#### DATE: 2023-06-02


## Project Summary
Implementing a digital menu and point-of-sale (POS) system that will be guest-facing in the bars at North and Downtown Sauce & Spoon locations. This initiative will take the form of a fully integrated tablet system located at each table to offer guests a seamless ordering experience—and at the same time provide the restaurant with a more effective ticketing system by the end of Q2.


## Project Goals
- Digitizing the order process by the start of Q2
- Reduce food waste by 25% by the end of Q2
- Train 100% of the staff at both North and Downtown locations on the new system before the start of Q2
- Decrease average table turn time by approximately 30 minutes by the end of the second quarter (Q2), resulting in decreased customer wait time
- Increase daily guest counts by 10% by the end of Q2
- Increase average check total to $75 by selling more appetizers and beverages by the end of Q2, resulting in increased profits.
- Increase appetizer sales by 15% average(North location targeted for a 10% increase and the Downtown location targeted for a 20% increase) by the end of Q2


## Deliverables
- Tablets installed in the bar area of North and Downtown restaurant locations before the start of Q2
- POS software developed for customers to use for digital orders
- Sourced tablets from electronics merchandiser
- Host software integrated with POS software on table tablets by the start of Q2
- Improve employee satisfaction with metrics (TDB)

## Appendix:
- Misalignment- reallocate payroll from the front of house to the back of house to hire more staff in order to meet increased demands.
  - Director of Operations and GM-Downtown suggest monitoring the payroll and bandwidth of the kitchen staff, and opening 2 part-time line cook roles in the meantime.
  - GM-North doesn’t want to give up Front of House payroll in case there is a need for more hosts/bartenders with the increased demand the tablets will potentially create.
  - Not resolved
- Misalignment on whether to include the guest wait time as a separate goal from the decrease in table turn time
